      <p>
        I am a curious technologist that has been working in the diagnostic
        healthcare sector for the past 5 years. I have been working at various
        departments, gaining experience across a wide range of imaging software
        systems. I enjoy being able to learn new skills and abilities in a
        variety of different fields. I started to complete web development short
        courses at the end of 2021 (and absolutely loved it). I have been
        completing bootcamps/short tech courses, while working on some personal
        projects (shown in my GitHub â€“ my personal favourite is my cocktail
        list)
