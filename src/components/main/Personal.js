      <p>
        I am a curious technologist that has been working in the diagnostic
        healthcare sector for the past 5 years. I enjoy being able to learn new
        skills and abilities in a variety of different fields. I started to
        complete web development short courses at the end of 2021 (and
        absolutely loved it). I have been completing bootcamps/short tech
        courses, while working on some personal projects (my personal favourite
        is my cocktail list)
